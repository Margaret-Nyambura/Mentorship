Trevor Noah, his mother Patricia Noah, and his younger brother Andrew lived in Eden Park, Jahannesburg.
His mother was a very resilient, courageous, and religious woman who never missed church. Trevor and his family went to three churches every Sunday. Trevor was a champion in sports at Maryvale Catholic, a private school that he attended. Patricia had an old 
Volkswagen second hand car, which Trevor believed made things worse. One Sunday, his mother’s car broke down, and they had to use the a bus to go to church.
Unfortunately, they had to walk since no bus showed up. Patricia was a Xhosa who were believed to be unfaithful compared to Zulu women, who were dutiful and mannered. 
As they were going home from the church, it was already late at night, and no bus had shown up. A car drove by and offered them a ride, however, after a few miles, a bus drove past them and ordered them to board the bus. 
The men in the bus abused Patricia for being an unfaithful Xhosa woman, and told her that she would learn a lesson that night. When the bus slowed down at the next petrol station, Trevor’s mother threw 
him out of the bus and then jumped off with baby Andrew. Patricia told Trevor to run as the men tried to chase them. They reached a petrol station, where they called the police, who took them home.<br>

Trevor was a mixed child, his father was German and his mother was black. During apartheid, black men worked in farms 
At age 22, Patricia ran away from home to Johannesburg. Robert, Trevor’s father, lived down the corridor in 206. He was 46 when Patricia was 24. 
She always felt comfortable being with Robert. On February 20, 1984, 
Trevor was born. Trevor never played outside, and every time they would go to the park, a lady called Queen was invited to walk with Trevor. 
One day, Trevor dug a hole under the gate and went outside. Some time later, Trevor found out that there were many mixed children outside who were smuggled through Botswana and Lesotho to be raised in England and Germany.
